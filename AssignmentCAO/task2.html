	Switch the CPU into LongMode to switch the kernel into 64bit Mode.</h3>
	<h2>
	What is Long Mode?</h2>
	<p>In the x86-64 computer architecture, long mode is the mode where a 64-bit operating system can access 64-bit instructions and registers. 64-bit programs are run in a sub-mode called 64-bit mode, while 32-bit programs and 16-bit protected mode programs are executed in a sub-mode called compatibility mode.</p>

	Paging allows us to enter submode which is implemented in main.asm</h3>
	
	<h2>What is paging?</h2>
	<p>In computer operating systems, memory paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory (virtual memory concept). In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages.
